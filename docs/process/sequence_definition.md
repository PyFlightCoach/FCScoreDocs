Developing a computer model of an aerobatic sequence and the associated judging criteria is a fundamental part of the judging process.

## Principal Elements

An aerobatic manoeuvre is formed from a group of principal elements flown sequentially. A principal element is a basic building block and may be a loop, line (or roll), snap, spin or stallturn. We will add support for tailslides in a future release. All of these elements have a set of parameters that can be used to scale them, or adjust their geometry in other ways. For example, a line element has a length, a speed and a roll angle to integrate along its length.

As part of the judging process we have developed a method of automatically generating flight data to represent the principal elements and you have been able to view these template flights in the Flight Coach plotter for quite a while. The template generation process also creates all the downgrades applicable to the manoeuvre based on the rules of the aerobatic category the sequence is defined for.

## Available Sequences

The definition of new sequences is not trivial. Eventually we hope to introduce a user interface to allow you to create your own sequences and to parse olan strings. Until then the sequences available in FCScore can be viewed here and we will try to keep up to date with the known sequences for most aerobatic categories and unknowns can be added on request.
