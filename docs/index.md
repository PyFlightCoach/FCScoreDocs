# Flight Coach Score Documentation

[FCScore](https://www.flightcoach.org/fcscore/) is a web application for the automatic judging of precision aerobatic flights based on recorded flight data. This site describes its use, documents the analysis process and explains how scores are calculated. A high level overview of the scoring process was described in the journal article [Automatic Judging for Precision Aerobatics](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/admin/files/477795448/Automatic_Judging_for_Precision_Aerobatics.pdf) published in the AIAA Journal of Aircraft.
